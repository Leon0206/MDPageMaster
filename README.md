## Description:

It is a page routing solution developed to help decouple code modules. Upon application startup, it binds URL information to ViewController information, enabling page jumping based on the URL. It supports internal and external jumping, storyboard page jumping, forward and backward data transmission, navigation management, custom navigation animation, etc. Its aim is to standardize project navigation management and avoid navigation confusion. For large-scale, collaborative projects, it is an essential tool.
